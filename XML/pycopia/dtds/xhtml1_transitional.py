# 


#  horizontal placement of table relative to document 


#  horizontal alignment attributes for cell contents

# 
# colgroup groups a set of col elements. It allows you to group
# several semantically related columns together.
# 


# 
#  col elements define the alignment properties for cells in
#  one or more columns.
# 
#  The width attribute specifies the width of the columns, e.g.
# 
#      width=64        width in screen pixels
#      width=0.5*      relative width of 0.5
# 
#  The span attribute causes the attributes of one
#  col element to apply to more than one column.
# 


# 
#     Use thead to duplicate headers when breaking table
#     across page boundaries, or for static headers when
#     tbody sections are rendered in scrolling panel.
# 
#     Use tfoot to duplicate footers when breaking table
#     across page boundaries, or for static footers when
#     tbody sections are rendered in scrolling panel.
# 
#     Use multiple tbody sections when rules are needed
#     between groups of table rows.
# 


#  Scope is simpler than headers attribute for common tables 


#  th is for headers, td for data and for cells acting as both
